Analyzing theory, application, and gender in research

## Overview

**NeurIPS-XML contains:**

- All paper information from 2010-2020 NeurIPS conference in XML files (Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems ##: Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems)
- In more recent years (2018-2020), the amount of papers surpasses 1,000 and dblp only allows for 1,000 papers per XML file so there may be some papers missing in 2018-2020
- XML files in folder are organized as "(conference number)"
- All papers are from "advances in neural information processsing systems..." I think that the other topics "proceedings, workshop, etc. may be application while the main one "advances in neural infromation processing..." is theory... so everything in this folder should be theory
